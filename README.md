# Powertable

# Description
A conversion of [Muonw's](https://github.com/muonw) fantastic [Powertable](https://github.com/muonw/powertable) component. Allows filtering, wildcard search, custom formatting and more!

This is still in Beta, so please let me know of any bugs.

## Instructions

1. Set up a Data Provider

2. Select either a table or custom query as the source.

3. Add a PowerTable as a child component to the dataprovider.
